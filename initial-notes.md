# Initial notes on simple meanings

00. The Fool - The Neophyte (BBS terminology? Where did I pick that up as meaning "someone learning to hack"?)
01. The Magician - The Skiddie (Marseilles meaning more than R-W-S or Thoth here; magician as in shell games and sleight-of-hand, not high magic)
02. The High Priestess
03. The Empress
04. The Emperor
05. The Hierophant - The Sysadmin (Laying down the Law)
06. The Lovers - The Conditional Branch (Connecting choice with mysteries of math, indeterminability, ghost-in-the-machine)
07. The Chariot - The Start-Up / The Compiler
08. Justice - The RFC
09. The Hermit - The Hacker (Trumps the RFC, studies introverted knowledge, set apart from the world yet very present in it)
10. Wheel of Fortune
11. Strength
12. The Hanged Man
13. Death - The Reinstall (This emphasizes Death as "picking up the pieces" rather than "clean slate" but retains the notion of "it happens to us all")
14. Temperance
15. The Devil
16. The Tower
17. The Star
18. The Moon - The Deep Web (This is heavily connected to a *personal* interpretation of The Moon!)
19. The Sun
20. Judgment - The Audit
21. The World - Abstraction
