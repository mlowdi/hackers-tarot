# Initial notes on simple meanings

## The Fool 
*The Neophyte* 

I seem to remember this as BBS terminology. Where did I pick that up as meaning "someone learning to hack"?

A beginner with an empty prompt and not much else. What happens if I type `rm -rf /`? Oops. Oh well.

## The Magician
*The Skiddie* 

The Marseilles meaning more than R-W-S or Thoth here; magician as in shell games and sleight-of-hand, not high magic.

## The High Priestess
## The Empress
## The Emperor
## The Hierophant
*The Sysadmin*

Laying down the Law

## The Lovers
*The Conditional Branch*

Connecting choice with mysteries of math, indeterminability, ghost-in-the-machine

## The Chariot
*The Start-Up / The Compiler*

## Justice
*The RFC*

## The Hermit
*The Hacker*

Trumps the RFC, studies introverted knowledge, set apart from the world yet very present in it.

## Wheel of Fortune
## Strength
## The Hanged Man
## Death
*The Reinstall*

This emphasizes Death as "picking up the pieces" rather than "clean slate" but retains the notion of "it happens to us all".

## Temperance
## The Devil
## The Tower
## The Star
## The Moon
*The Deep Web*

Intution and mysteries dominate. The path is obscured but not invisible. Beware.

Not the flip-side of the Sun but rather the necessary reflection of it -- just like the moon actually is. This is heavily connected to a *personal* interpretation of The Moon! Not necessarily canon.

## The Sun
## Judgment
*The Audit*

## The World
*Abstraction*

Finally attained enlightenment. Freedom from the rigors of the language -- but also the start of a new cycle of learning and exploring.

Also the coveted abstraction, the bird's eye view, that hackerdom seeks. To generalize what you know about coffee makers and apply it to the plugged drain.
