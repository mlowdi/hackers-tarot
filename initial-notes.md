# Initial notes on simple meanings

If referring to cards by numbers remember that the first card (of course) is 0. It's not unnumbered!

Also, we're currently on the Marseille ordering with Justice before Strength rather than the other way around. Maybe this will change.

## The Fool 
**The Hacker**

The central figure of the story; the journeyman on a vision quest; the seeker of knowledge and the seer of this world.

Also careless, boastful, curious until the very end.

Funny enough, card number 0 is sometimes referred to as the cipher or the cipher card.

## The Magician
**The Skiddie**

He feels the master of the Universe, dominating the fools and harnessing great power. In reality he's in his mother's basement, eating Cheetos, DDoSing the CIA.

The Marseilles meaning more than R-W-S or Thoth here; magician as in shell games and sleight-of-hand, not high magic.

## The High Priestess
## The Empress
## The Emperor
## The Hierophant
**The Sysadmin**

Laying down the Law. The interpreter of the worldly side of the spiritual wisdom: thus is how a computer shall be used.

## The Lovers
**The Conditional Branch**

You may have one or the other, but never both. You will not know which one you choose, or where the choice may lead, until you are faced with it.

Connecting choice with mysteries of math, indeterminability, ghost-in-the-machine

## The Chariot
**The Start-Up / The Compiler**

## Justice
**The RFC**

## The Hermit
## Wheel of Fortune
## Strength
## The Hanged Man
## Death
**The Reinstall**

This emphasizes Death as "picking up the pieces" rather than "clean slate" but retains the notion of "it happens to us all".

## Temperance
## The Devil
## The Tower
## The Star
## The Moon
**The Deep Web**

Intution and mysteries dominate. The path is obscured but not invisible. Beware.

Not the flip-side of the Sun but rather the necessary reflection of it -- just like the moon actually is. This is heavily connected to a *personal* interpretation of The Moon! Not necessarily canon.

## The Sun
## Judgment
**The Audit**

## The World
**Abstraction**

Finally attained enlightenment. Freedom from the limitations of the language -- but also the start of a new cycle of learning and exploring.

Fullness, mastery, finality. All there is to have. Or is it?

Also the coveted bird's eye view that hackerdom seeks. To generalize what you know about coffee makers and apply it to the plugged drain.
