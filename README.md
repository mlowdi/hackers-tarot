# The Hacker's Tarot
Licensed under CC-BY-SA 3.0
## Summary
The Hacker's Tarot is meant as a very serious joke, with the goal of composing a Major Arcana for and by hackers, referencing the archetypes of the hacker world and the hacker mindset.

We try not to stick to one Tarot tradition, while at the same time following the traditions very closely. There will surely be influences from at least the three big ones ([Rider-Waite-Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider-Waite_tarot_deck), [Marseilles](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tarot_of_Marseilles) and [Thoth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thoth_tarot_deck)), and likely also elements of Wicca and other interpretations of the meanings of the cards. 

Why this is a "very serious joke" rather than a simple joke is because there's care put into the symbols used. If someone were to illustrate these cards you could read them as well as you read your ordinary Major Arcana.

## A *real* Hacker's Tarot
There are various "cyber" Tarot decks out there already. But in many ways they generally reflect a pop cultural cyberpunk vision of the hacker as a veritable wizard waving his (always his!) fingers at computers that immediately do his bidding. This is, of course, not at all how hacking works.

To not use the rich spiritual and religious symbology already present in hackerdom is honestly speaking kind of ridiculous.

A *real* Hacker's Tarot shouldn't copy icons from hackerdom onto superficially similar archetypes (like replacing the High Priestess with Trinity from *The Matrix*, or even with [Admiral Grace Hopper](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper)) What would make more sense, then, is to look at the symbolical interpretations of the card and work backwards from there. What represents these values within hackerdom? (TODO: Add the actual correspondence for the High Priestess once I figure it out.)

## Motivation


### Inclusivity
- Not everyone is comfortable with the Christian symbolism in the Marseilles deck
- Not everyone is comfortable with the astrological and Hermetic symbolism in the Rider-Waite-Smith deck
- Not everyone is comfortable with the symbolism Aleister Crowley put into the Thoth deck
- Not everyone is familiar enough with the symbology present in either tradition to successfully read it in their own words

### Openness
- While most of the Tarot symbology sets are general enough to be practically free and the only copyrightable material is the paintings on the cards, why not create a CC licensed set of cards?

### Fun!
- It's great fun creating a cultural artefact together!

## Why hackerdom?
The hacker world is laden with symbology and myth. From [The Story of Mel](https://www.cs.utah.edu/~elb/folklore/mel.html) to modern semi-mythical creatures like Anonymous and, yes, even the NSA, we live and breathe symbology in a way that can only be described as close to religious. In fact, likening modern-day hackers to monks or some other order of holy people isn't that far off -- not too much of a strech if you can at least imagine a church built on irreverence!

Of course this group for modern-day mechanics of the mind need a Tarot to guide their way. A *real* Tarot. Not some wishy-washy set of "oracle cards" or "divination cards".

## What about the Minor Arcana?
If someone feels up to the task then go right ahead and do it!

For my part I imagine the Hacker's Tarot can be read on its own, as many do with the Major Arcana, or used together either with Rider-Waite tradition painted pip cards or Marseille-style symbolic pip cards.
