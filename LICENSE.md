(?) 2015

This license will be some sort of free and open license, but I/we are not sure which one yet. Assume I want you to credit and share-alike (like CC-BY-SA), but with the exact details yet to be revealed. I don't like the GNU licenses for software particularily, but then again the BSD licenses are pretty crap for written material and I haven't gotten around to looking at how GPL protects art.

But maybe if I could choose I'd ask you to use this project, no matter the license, with respect and kindness for everyone. Don't rip someone else's stuff off just to make money, but on the other hand don't let the work being someone else's originally stand in the way of you making some money as a side-effect of it. Maybe you want to become a Hacker Tarot Reader and get money from reading people's fortunes at CCCamp. In that case that's cool and all. But if you take this document and start a Kickstarter and get bought out by US Game Systems or whatever they're called once the first batch of cards have shipped you actually owe me some money, champ. Cough it up.

In the same vein, don't take this work and claim it as your own. Credit the authors (they're either in the Git log or in the README.md) and credit those who wrote and taught the Tarot well before this document came into existence. Don't be a total jerk.

Hey, I think I figured out a pretty decent license for this document. It will do for now.
